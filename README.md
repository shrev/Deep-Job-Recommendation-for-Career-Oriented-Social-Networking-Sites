# Deep-Job-Recommendation-for-Career-Oriented-Social-Networking-Sites

Job recommendation has paved way to become one of the most sought after domains to deploy recommender systems. Business social networking sites have an increasing demand for accurate job recommendations that grows by the day. Deep learning for recommendation is a recent trend that comes with promising results. In this project a neighborhood-based approach for job recommendations using Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL) has been used. CDL has been used in the past to achieve high quality of recommendation by solving the sparse matrix problem. We combine CDL with user clustering to achieve scalability and significant accuracy under sparse settings. Furthermore it is observed that the latent semantic information extracted from the chosen neighbourhoods leads to effective representation and gives high recall.
